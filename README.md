The nearest neighbor algorithm gets the shortest route from the initial course whenever generating the result. It will always check for the journey to reduce one city from the way, which is the shortest route, and then it will run again for the remaining cities until it gets the best result. It follows the pattern until there are no remaining cities. The distance of the shortest route for this algorithm is 7184 miles.
