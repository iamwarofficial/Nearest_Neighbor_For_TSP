# Nearest Neighbor For TSP
 
 The developer has implemented the nearest neighbor algorithm into the Java Platform. To make the trials fair, the author used the same number of US-based cities. The distance between each city is identified by its latitude and longitudes coordinates. The Haversine formula is used to calculate distances between cities. The Haversine formula calculates the shortest distance between two points on a sphere using their latitudes and longitudes measured along the surface. It is essential for use in navigation.

 In the nearest neighbor algorithm, the program gets the shortest route from the initial course whenever generating the result. It will always check for the journey to reduce one city from the way as it is the shortest route, and then it will run again for the remaining cities until it gets the best result. It follows the pattern until there are no remaining cities. The distance of the shortest route for this algorithm is 7184 miles.
